# Colour Scheme Generator ðŸŸ ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ

This is my first app using an API, it's part of the solo project on Module 9 Scrimba Frontend Career path. The idea was to create a palette of colours using an API, it was so much fun to expand my knowledge even more.

## ðŸ’» Reflection


- This project has been built with the purpose of completing the Solo Project on the Scrimba Frontend Career path. It was a life changer to learn all possibilities using API and this is just the beginning of an exciting journey. I've spent 1 day finishing this off, spending the majority of the time studying and applying the API fetch.


- There were a few challenges on this project, such as how to concatenate the values I was getting from the form, which was solved using the concat( ) function.


- Skills learned: fetch(), then(), concat(), API.
